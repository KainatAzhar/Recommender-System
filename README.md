# Recommender System with Collaborative Filtering (SVD)

### Project Overview
This project develops a personalized recommender system using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**, a core matrix factorization technique in **collaborative filtering**. The goal is to predict a user's preference for items they haven't interacted with by leveraging the behavior of similar users. This is a critical skill for building applications that enhance user engagement and personalization.

### Dataset
The model is trained on a synthetic dataset representing user ratings for a set of items (e.g., movies, products). The data is structured to simulate a user-item rating matrix, a standard format for collaborative filtering.

### Methodology
1.  **Data Generation and Preprocessing:** A synthetic user-item rating dataset is generated. The data is then loaded into a format suitable for the **Surprise** library, a specialized tool for building recommender systems.
2.  **Model Selection and Training:** The **SVD algorithm** is selected and trained on the user-item rating data. SVD factorizes the rating matrix into two lower-dimensional matrices representing user and item latent features.
3.  **Evaluation:** The model's predictive accuracy is evaluated using standard metrics for recommender systems, such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
4.  **Recommendation Generation:** The trained model is used to predict ratings for unseen items and generate a list of personalized recommendations for a target user.

### Concluded Results
The recommender system successfully generates accurate predictions, as evidenced by a low RMSE score. The final recommendations are highly relevant to the target user's preferences, showcasing the model's ability to learn complex patterns in user behavior. This project demonstrates strong skills in building data-driven recommendation engines and is a key asset for a career in data science or AI.
